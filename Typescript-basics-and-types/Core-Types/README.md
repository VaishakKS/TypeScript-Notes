# core types
These are the types javascript already knows<br>

1. **number:** In Javascript there's no special types like integer , float ,decimal etc., all these fall under the category of number type. for example, `5, 2.5, -10` all fall under the number type.
2. **string:** This includes texts , characters enclosed between single quotes(''), double quotes(""), and back ticks(``).
3. **boolean:** This includes `true` and `false`. 

***Note:*** Typescript will throw errors only during developement. It will throw an error during runtime but the code gets compiled to javascript. It helps in writing more cleaner code.
