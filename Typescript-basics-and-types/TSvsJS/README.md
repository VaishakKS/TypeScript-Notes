# Typescript vs Javascript

The major difference between typescript and javascript is that , typescript is `statically typed` and javascript is `dynamically typed`.<br>

So let's consider variable assignment in both typescript and javscript.

In Javascript, If we create a variable `var status` and initialize this variable with a number ,let's say `status = 5`.<br>
This variable can hold value of any other type in later stages of program. Let's update the variable with a string value `status = 'Okay'`.<br>
This how javascript works. Types are dynamically assigned to the variables.

With the case of typescript, If we decalre a variable with a particular type , let's say `var status:number` the value of the status has to updated with a numerical value only. Hence types are statically assigned in typescript.

**Note**: Typescript is used only for development purpose , it cannot be used to render on screen like javascript.
In the Html file, the script tag will contain the Javascript file. Typescript is a means to develop that javascript file.
